This is my journey through Om's River.  It's a meditation, a place to explore thoughts, questions and maybe a discover a few answers.  In the world we live today, there's plenty to distract us.  Then finding answers is not so clear.  

Meditation can be a way to find those answers.  But it is not the drama that we've made it out to be - it is a simple process to sit quietly and undistracted by the world around you, then let thoughts come, but most importantly to let them go as well.

Somewhere in there will be a moment of insight - may into your day, a problem that's been plagueing you or just a deicision on what you should do next.  There are important aspects to remember though, that sometimes the answers won't come immediately.  You'll have to wait, I'm sorry.  Sometimes, they may not be what you thought, and deep inside a very sublte voice and feeling will tell you if it's the right thing to do.

Take the time.
